NAME
    wait - wait for a process to complete

DESCRIPTION
    The wait command waits for a specified process to complete.

SYNOPSIS
    #include <sys/wait.h>
    pid_t wait(int *stat_loc);
    pid_t waitpid(pid_t pid, int *stat_loc, int options);

OPTIONS
    WNOHANG     		return immediately if no child has exited.
    WUNTRACED   		also return if a child has stopped (but not traced via ptrace(2)). Status for traced children which have stopped is provided even if this option is not specified.
    WCONTINUED 			(since Linux 2.6.10)also return if a stopped child has been resumed by delivery of SIGCONT.
    WIFEXITED(wstatus)		returns true if the child terminated normally, that is, by calling exit(3) or _exit(2), or by returning from main().
    WEXITSTATUS(wstatus)	returns  the  exit  status  of  the child.  This consists of the least significant 8 bits of the status argument that  the  child
              			specified in a call to exit(3) or _exit(2) or as the argument for a return statement in main().  This macro should be employed only if WIFEXITED returned true.
    WIFSIGNALED(wstatus)	returns true if the child process was terminated by a signal.
    WTERMSIG(wstatus)		returns the number of the signal that caused the child process to terminate. This macro should be employed only if WIFSIGNALED returned true.
    WCOREDUMP(wstatus)		returns true if the child produced a core dump (see core(5)). This macro should be employed only if WIFSIGNALED returned true.
    WIFSTOPPED(wstatus)		returns true if the child process was stopped by delivery of a signal;  this is possible only if the call was done using WUNTRACED or when the child is being traced.
    WSTOPSIG(wstatus)		returns the number of the signal which caused the child to stop. This macro should be employed only if WIFSTOPPED returned true.
    WIFCONTINUED(wstatus)	(since  Linux  2.6.10) returns true if the child process was resumed by delivery of SIGCONT.
