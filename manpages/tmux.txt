NAME
       tmux -- terminal	multiplexer

SYNOPSIS
       tmux   [-2CDluvV]   [-c	 shell-command]	 [-f  file]  [-L  socket-name]
	    [-S	socket-path] [-T features] [command [flags]]

DESCRIPTION
       tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals	to  be created,	 accessed,  and	 controlled from a single screen.  tmux	may be detached	from a screen and continue running  in	the  background,  then
       later reattached.

OPTIONS

       -2	     			Force  tmux  to assume the terminal supports 256 colours. This is equivalent to -T 256.
       -C	     			Start in control mode (see the "CONTROL MODE"  section). Given twice (-CC) disables echo.
       -c shell-command			Execute shell-command using the default shell. If necessary, the tmux server will be started to retrieve the default-shell option. This option is for compatibility with sh(1) when tmux is used as a login shell.
       -D	     			Do not start the tmux server as a daemon. This also turns the exit-empty option off. With -D, command may not be specified.
       -f file	     			Specify an alternative configuration file.
       -L socket-name			This option allows a different socket name to be specified, allowing several independent tmux servers to be run. Unlike -S a full path is not	necessary: the sockets are all created in a directory tmux-UID
		     			under the directory given by TMUX_TMPDIR or in /tmp
       -l	     			Behave as a login shell.  This flag currently has no  effect  and is for compatibility with other shells when using tmux as a login shell.
       -N	     			Do not start the server even if the  command  would  normally do so (for example new-session or start-server).
       -S socket-path			Specify a full alternative path to the server socket. If -S is specified, the default socket directory is not used and any -L flag is ignored.
       -u	     			Write  UTF-8 output to the terminal even if the first environment variable of LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG that is set does not contain "UTF-8" or "UTF8". This is equivalent to -T UTF-8.
       -T features   			Set terminal features for the client. This is a	comma-separated	list of features.  See the terminal-features option.
       -v	     			Request verbose logging.  Log messages will be saved into tmux-client-PID.log and tmux-server-PID.log files in  the current  directory, where PID is the PID of the server or client process.  
					If -v is specified twice, an  additional tmux-out-PID.log  file is generated with a copy of everything tmux writes to the terminal.
       -V	     			Report the tmux version.
