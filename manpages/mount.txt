NAME
   mount- Mount a file systemAll files accessible in a Unix system are arranged in one big tree, the file hierarchy, rooted at /. These files can be spread out over several devices. The mount command serves to attach the file system found on some device to the big file tree.

Syntax
       	mount -a [-fFnrsvw] [-t vfstype]

       	mount [-fnrsvw] [-o options [,...]] device | dir

       	mount [-fnrsvw] [-t vfstype] [-o options] device dir

      	mount [-hV]

DESCRIPTION
	All files accessible in a Unix system are arranged in one big tree, the file hierarchy, rooted at /. These files can be spread out over several devices. The mount command serves to attach the file system found on some device to the big file tree.

OPTIONS

   -a     		Mount  all  filesystems  (of  the given types) mentioned in fstab.

   -F     		(Used in conjunction with  -a.)   Fork  off  a  new incarnation of mount for each device.  This will do the mounts on different devices
          		or  different NFS servers in parallel.

   -f     		Causes  everything to be done except for the actual system call; if it’s not  obvious, this 'fakes' mounting the file system.
          

   -n     		Mount without writing in /etc/mtab. This is necessary for example when /etc is on a read-only file system.

   -s     		Tolerate  sloppy mount options rather than failing. This option exists for support of the Linux autofs-based automounter.

   -r     		Mount  the  file  system read-only. A synonym is -o ro

   -w     		Mount the  file  system  read/write.  This is the default. A synonym is -o rw.

   -L label		Mount the partition that has the specified label.

   -U uuid		Mount  the  partition  that has the specified uuid.

   -o     		Several -o options can be specified in a comma separated string ...
  

          async  	All  I/O  to  the file system should be done asynchronously.

          atime  	Update inode access time  for  each  access. This is the default.

          noatime	Do  not  update  inode  access times on this file system (e.g, for faster access  on  the news spool to speed up news servers).

          auto   	Can be mounted with the -a option.

          noauto 	Can only be mounted explicitly (i.e., the -a option will not cause the file system to  be mounted).

          ro     	Mount the file system read-only.

          rw     	Mount the file system read-write.

          suid   	Allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier bits to take effect.

          sync   	All  I/O  to  the file system should be done synchronously.


   -t vfstype		The  argument  following the -t is used to indicate the file system type.

   -h    		 Print a help message.

   -V     		Output version.

   -v     		Verbose mode.


EXAMPLE
    mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
    mount -t ext4 /dev/sda1 /mnt
