NAME
    more - Display output one screen at a time, less provides more emulation and extensive enhancements.

SYNOPSIS
    more [-dlfpcsu] [-num] [+/ pattern] [+ linenum] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
    more is a filter for paging through text one screenful at a time.
    This version is especially primitive. Users should realize that
    less(1) provides more(1) emulation plus extensive enhancements.

OPTIONS
   -d, --silent                    Prompt with "[Press space to continue, 'q' to quit.]", and
                                   display "[Press 'h' for instructions.]" instead of ringing
                                   the bell when an illegal key is pressed.

   -l, --logical                   Do not pause after any line containing a ^L (form feed).

   -e, --exit-on-eof               Exit on End-Of-File, enabled by default if POSIXLY_CORRECT
                                   environment variable is not set or if not executed on
                                   terminal.

   -f, --no-pause                  Count logical lines, rather than screen lines (i.e., long
                                   lines are not folded).

   -p, --print-over                Do not scroll. Instead, clear the whole screen and then
                                   display the text. Notice that this option is switched on
                                   automatically if the executable is named page.

   -c, --clean-print               Do not scroll. Instead, paint each screen from the top,
                                   clearing the remainder of each line as it is displayed.

   -s, --squeeze                   Squeeze multiple blank lines into one.

   -u, --plain                     Suppress underlining. This option is silently ignored as
                                   backwards compatibility.

   -n, --lines number              Specify the number of lines per screenful. The number
                                   argument is a positive decimal integer. The --lines option
                                   shall override any values obtained from any other source,
                                   such as number of lines reported by terminal.

   -number                         A numeric option means the same as --lines option argument.

   +number                         Start displaying each file at line number.

   +/string                        The string to be searched in each file before starting to
                                   display it.

   -h, --help                      Display help text and exit.

   -V, --version                   Print version and exit.
